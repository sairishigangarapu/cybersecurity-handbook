# 3. Threat Actors

A **threat actor** (or malicious actor) is an individual or group that performs a malicious action (a threat) against a cybersecurity target. Understanding their motivations and capabilities is key to building effective defenses.

## Threat Actor Attributes

- **Internal vs. External**:
    
    - **Internal**: Actors from within the organization (e.g., employees, contractors). They are particularly dangerous because they already have some level of trust and access.
        
    - **External**: Actors operating from outside the organization.
        
- **Level of Sophistication**: The technical skill, operational discipline, and capabilities of the actor. This ranges from low (using simple, pre-made tools) to high (developing custom malware and zero-day exploits).
    
- **Resources and Funding**: The financial backing and resources available to the actor. A lone hacker has limited resources, while a nation-state has a nearly unlimited budget.
    
- **Intent/Motivation**: The underlying reason for the attack. This is the most important attribute for predicting an actor's behavior.
    

## Types of Threat Actors

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Actor Type**|**Common Motivation(s)**|**Typical Sophistication/Resources**|
|**Script Kiddie**|Thrill, curiosity, recognition, showing off|Low / Low|
|**Hacktivist**|Political, social, or ideological agenda|Low to Medium / Low|
|**Insider Threat**|**Malicious:** Revenge, financial gain. **Accidental:** Negligence, error.|Varies / Varies|
|**Organized Crime**|Purely financial gain|Medium to High / High|
|**Competitors**|Corporate espionage, stealing trade secrets|Medium to High / Medium|
|**Nation-State (APT)**|Espionage, sabotage, projecting national power|Very High / Very High|

## In-Depth Actor Profiles

- **Script Kiddie**: An unskilled attacker who uses scripts or tools developed by others (e.g., Metasploit, password crackers) to attack systems. They typically lack the ability to write their own exploits and often attack for bragging rights.
    
- **Hacktivist**: An individual or group that uses hacking to promote a social or political cause. Their attacks are often disruptive, such as website defacements or DDoS attacks, aimed at bringing attention to their cause. (e.g., Anonymous).
    
- **Insider Threat**: One of the most dangerous threats due to their pre-existing access.
    
    - **Malicious Insider**: A disgruntled employee who intentionally steals data or disrupts operations.
        
    - **Accidental Insider**: An employee who makes a security mistake out of negligence or ignorance, such as falling for a phishing attack or losing a company laptop.
        
- **Organized Crime**: A criminal enterprise focused on profit. They are behind most large-scale financial attacks, such as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), credit card theft, and banking trojans. They are professional, well-funded, and operate like a business.
    
- **Competitors**: Organizations that attack a rival to steal intellectual property (e.g., product designs, business plans) or disrupt their services to gain a market advantage.
    
- **Nation-State Actor / APT**: **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** are sponsored by governments and are the most sophisticated actors. They have immense resources, high levels of skill, and their goal is long-term intrusion (**persistence**) for espionage or to position themselves for future sabotage. Their targets are typically critical infrastructure, government agencies, and major corporations.
