# 5. Social Engineering

**Social engineering** is the art and science of manipulating people to perform actions or divulge confidential information. It is a non-technical attack that exploits human psychology and trust rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## The Principles of Influence (Motivational Triggers)

Attackers leverage these psychological principles to make their requests seem legitimate and compelling.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Principle**|**Description**|**Phishing Example**|
|**Authority**|People tend to obey figures of authority.|"From: IT Help Desk. Your password has expired. Click here to reset it immediately."|
|**Urgency**|People are more likely to act when they feel a sense of time pressure.|"Your account has been compromised! You have 24 hours to verify your identity or it will be locked."|
|**Social Proof**|People look to the actions of others to guide their own behavior.|"90% of our employees have switched to the new secure portal. You are one of the last to migrate."|
|**Scarcity**|People want things more if they believe the resource is limited.|"This exclusive offer for a free gift card is only available to the first 50 respondents."|
|**Likability**|People are more easily persuaded by those they like or find appealing.|An attacker builds rapport over time before making a malicious request.|
|**Fear**|Fear of a negative consequence can motivate immediate action.|"We have detected illegal activity on your computer. Install this security tool now to avoid prosecution."|
|**Intimidation**|Using a forceful or bullying tone to coerce a victim into compliance.|An attacker impersonating a CEO angrily demanding an immediate wire transfer.|

## Phishing Attacks

Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information.

- **Phishing**: A broad, shotgun-style attack sent to a large number of recipients.
    
- **Spear Phishing**: A targeted attack that is customized for a specific individual, group, or organization. The message often contains personal details to make it more convincing.
    
- **Whaling**: A form of spear phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals like CEOs, CFOs, or other senior executives. The goal is often to perform a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack.
    
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: A sophisticated attack where the attacker impersonates a company executive to trick an employee into performing an unauthorized action, such as making a wire transfer or sending sensitive data.
    
- **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Phishing conducted over the phone.
    
- **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**: Phishing conducted via text messages.
    
- **Pharming**: A technical attack that redirects users from a legitimate website to a fraudulent one by poisoning a DNS server or modifying the victim's hosts file. **Key difference**: Phishing tricks the user; pharming tricks the system.
    

## Other Common Social Engineering Attacks

- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else (e.g., a help desk technician, a new employee, a delivery driver) to gain physical access or information.
    
- **Watering Hole Attack**: The attacker compromises a legitimate website that they know their target group frequently visits. When the targets visit the site, they are infected with malware.
    
- **Typosquatting**: Registering a domain name that is a common misspelling of a popular website (e.g., `Gogle.com` instead of `Google.com`) to capture and trick users.
    
- **Baiting**: Leaving malware-infected physical media (like a USB drive) labeled with something enticing (e.g., "Executive Salaries") in a location where someone will find and use it.
    
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Directly observing someone entering sensitive information (like a password or PIN) by looking over their shoulder.
    
- **Dumpster Diving**: Sifting through an organization's trash to find discarded documents, hard drives, or other items containing sensitive information.
    
- **Eavesdropping**: Secretly listening to a private conversation, either in person or by intercepting electronic communications.
