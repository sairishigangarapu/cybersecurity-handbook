## Introduction

### What is it
- Potential Security and operational challenges introduced by external entities (vendors, suppliers or service providers)

## Supply Chain Risks

### What is it
- Investigates on the risk can arise due faults in the supply chain of a given product
- Primarily it falls under 3 groups 
  - Hardware manufacturers  
    - Conduction of rigorous supply chain assessments is necessary in order to prevent any kind of faulty product from going into production
	- Procurement of products from aftermarket sources also do not guarentee a complete working of the product
  - Software products 
    - Software developers and software providers are integral cogs in the supply chains
    - Must always be accompanied with a antivirus and a firewall tool to prevent malicious activity
  - Managed Service providers
    - Organisations that provide a range of technology services and support to businesses and other clients 
    - They perform several things such as 
      - Evaluate data security measures
      - Ensure confidentiality and integrity
      - Assess cyber security protocols
      - Response to the security breach

## Supply Chain Attacks

### What is it
- Attack that involves targeting a weaker link in the supply chain to gain access to a primary target

- CHIPS Act
  - US federal statute that provides roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost research and manufacturing of semiconductors inside the United States

- Semiconductors
  - Essential components in a wide range of products,from smartphones and cars to medical devices and defence systems

- The attacks can be mitigated prevented by the following techniques
  - Vendor Due Diligence
  - Regular monitoring and Audits
  - Education and Collaboration
  - Incorporating Contractual safeguards

## Vendor Assessment

### What is it
- Process that organisations implement to evaluate the security , reliability and performance of external entities

### Classification
- Vendors
  - Businesses or individuals that provide goods or services to an organisation
- Suppliers
  - Individuals involved in the production and delivery of products or parts of products 
- Managed Service Providers
  - Individuals hired by companies to manage IT services on behalf of and organisation

### Performing the assessment
- Penetration Testing 
  - Simulated cyber-attack against the supplier’s system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities 
- The right to audit clause grants organisations the right to evaluate vendors
- Internal Audit
  - Vendor’s self-assessment where they evaluate their own practices against industry standards or organisational requirements
- Independent Assessment
  - Evaluation conducted by third-party entities that have no stake in the organisation’s or vendor’s operations
- Supply Chain Analysis
  - Used to dive deep into a vendor’s entire supply chain and assess the security and reliability of each link 
- Vendor Assessment 
  - Process that organisations implement to evaluate the security, reliability and performance of external entities

## Vendor Selection and Monitoring

- Due Diligence
  - Rigorous evaluation that goes beyond surface-level credentials 
- Conflict of Interest 
  - Arises when personal or financial relationships could potentially cloud the judgement of individuals involved in vendor selection
  - Organisations should always strive to achieve transparency
- Vendor Questionnaires
  - Comprehensive documents that potential vendors fill out to offer insights into the operations, capabilities and compliance
  - These might question many aspects , some of them being Data redundancy measures , Security protocols , Up-time Guarantees , Disaster Recovery plans
- Rules of Engagement
  - Guidelines that dictate the terms of interaction between and organisation and its potential vendors 
  - Communication protocols , Data sharing policies , negotiation boundaries
- Monitoring
  - Mechanism to ensure that the chosen vendor still aligns with the organisational needs and standards
  - Feedback Loops
    - Involve a two-way communication channel where both the organisation and the vendor share feedback

## Contracts and Agreements

### What is it

- Written documents that have set of rules , protocols and certain expectations and other terms dictating the trust and the obligations of the parties involved who will be partnering based on the document they have approved 
- Basic foundation of most business relationships

### Types

- Basic Contract
  - Versatile tool that formally establishes a relationship between two parties
  - With today’s standards , ventures require additional layers of agreement
- Service-Level Agreement (SLA)
  - The standard of service a client can expect from a provider
- Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
  - Formal and outlines the specific responsibilities and roles of the involved parties
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
  - Less binding and more of a declaration of mutual intent
- Master Service Agreement (MSA)
  - Blanket agreement that covers the general terms of engagement between parties across multiple transactions
- Statement of work (SOW)
  - Used to specify details for a particular project
  - Specifies the deliverables , Timelines , Milestones
- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
  - Commitment to privacy that ensures that any sensitive information shared during negotiations remains confidential between both parties
- Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)
  - Document that goes a step beyond the basic contract when two entities decide to pool their resources for mutual benefit
