
## Introduction

### What is Risk Management
- Fundamental process that involves identifying , analysing , treating , monitoring and reported risks

### Risk Assessment Frequency 
- Refers to how often the risk assessment process is conducted within and organisation
  
---
## Risk Assessment Frequency 

### What is it
- The Regularity with which risk assessment are conducted within an organisation 

### Types 

- Ad Hoc -
  - Conducted as and when needed, often in response to a specific event or situation that has the potential to introduce new risks or change the nature of existing risks

- Recurring Risk Assessments
  - Conducted at regular intervals , such as annually , quarterly or monthly
  - Financial institutions and big organisation perform them frequently
  - Penetration-testing is one such on finding the flaws in a system which is performed by ethical hackers

- One-Time Risk Assessments
  - Conducted for a specific purpose are not repeated
  - Such testing are performed during event like a New IT system , Construction Project or a Organisational change

- Continuous Risk Assessments
  - Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risks
  - Used in situation with continuous data flow
  - Depends on the organisation’s needs and the type of risks

## Risk Identification 

### What is it
- Recognising potential risks that could negatively impact an organisation’s ability to operate or achieve its objective
- Include steps like brainstorming , Checklists , Interviews and Scenario Analysis
- The organisation should consider a wide range of risks, including operational , financial , strategic and reputational risks
- After identifying potential risks, document and analyse them based on their possible impact and probability

### Business Impact Analysis
- What is it 
  - Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organisation’s business functions and processes

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
  - It represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of a business function severely impacts the organisation

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
  - It represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time 
  - If an organisation has a recovery point objective of four hours , it means the business can tolerate a data loss of up to four hours
    
- Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) 
  - It represents the average time required to repair a failed component or system

- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
  - It represents the average time between failures

## Risk Register 

### Risk Management
- Crucial for projects and business involving the identification and assessment of uncertainties that may impact objectives
- Risk Register is a key tool in risk management, featuring key risk indicators , risk owners and risk thresholds

### Risk Register 

- A document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact likelihood , and mitigation strategies
- Might also resemble the heat map risk matrix

- Risk Description
  - Entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk 

- Risk Impact 
  - Potential consequences if the risk materialises

- Risk Likelihood/Probability 
  - Chance of a particular risk occurring 

- Risk Outcome
  - Result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood

- Risk Level/Threshold
  - Determined by combining the impact and likelihood

- Cost 
  - Pertains to its financial impact on the project, including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of risk mitigation

- Risk Tolerance / Risk Acceptance 
  - Refers to an organisation or individuals’s willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals

- Risk Appetite 
  - Signifies an organisation’s willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals
    
     - Expansionary 
       - Organisation is open to taking more risk in the hopes of achieving greater returns
         
     - Conservative
       - Implies that an organisation favours less risk, even if it leads to lower returns
         
     - Neutral 
	   - Signifies a balance between risk and return 

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- Essential predictive metrics used by organisations to signal rising risk levels in different part of the enterprise
- KRIs help organisations evaluate the impact and likelihood of risks, allowing proactive management to prevent their escalation
  
### Risk Owner
- Person or group responsible for managing the risk 
  
---
## Qualitative Risk Analysis

### What is it
- A method of assessing risks based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence
- This method is subjective and relies on the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders
- Likelihood and probability refer to the chance of a particular risk occurring
- The impact refers to the potential consequences if the risk materialises
  
---
##  Quantitative Risk Analysis

### What is it
- Method of evaluating risk that uses numerical measurements
- It is a potent risk management tool, offering a numerical and objective assessment of risks

### Factors

- Exposure Factor (EF) - 
  - Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event
  - 0% = No loss , 100% = Total loss , HQ Flooding = 70% lost assets , EF = 70%

- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - 
  - Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event 
  - Value of asset X EF = SLE

- Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
  - Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within a year 

- Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE)
  - Expected annual loss from a risk 
  - SLE X ARO = ALE

## Risk Management Strategies

### Types

- Risk Transference (Risk Sharing)
  - Involves shifting the risk from the organisation to another party 
  - Contract Indemnity Clause
    -  A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the other’s harm , liability or loss stemming from the contract
  - Seeks to move the financial burden of a potential loss from one party to another
  - Risk Transference does not remove the risk but shifts the responsibility for handling its financial consequences

- Risk Acceptance
  - Recognising a risk and choosing to address it when it arises

- Exemption
  - Provision that grants an exception from a specific rule or requirement 

- Exception
  - Provision that permits a party to bypass a rule or requirement in certain situations
  - The party is assuming risk either by operating without the safeguards of a rule (exemption) or by operating in a way that lets them evade the risk (exception)

- Risk Avoidance
  - Strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific task

## Risk Monitoring And Reporting

### What is it
- Risk Monitoring
  - Involves continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plans, and evaluating their effectiveness during a project’s lifecycle
  - Helps in identification of primarily 2 kinds of risk
    - Residual Risk
      - Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation,transference, or acceptance measures on the initial risk
    - Control Risk
      - Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time

- Risk Reporting
  - Process of communicating information about risk management activities 
  - Its important due to several reasons, couple of them being 
    - Informed decision-making
      - Offer insights for informed decisions on resource allocation, project timelines and strategic planning
    - Risk mitigation
      - Recognise when a risk is escalating to mitigate it before becoming an issue
    - Stakeholder communication
      - Assist in setting expectations and showing effective risk management
    - Regulatory compliance
      - Demonstrate compliance with these regulations
