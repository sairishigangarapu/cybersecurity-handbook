## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a living documentation of my journey through the **CompTIA Security+** curriculum and broader Cybersecurity concepts. 

Unlike standard note-taking, this project focuses on **implementation**:
* **Theory:** Concise summaries of threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.
* **Labs:** Python and Bash scripts that demonstrate concepts like Port Scanning, Packet Sniffing, and Password Hashing in a safe, controlled environment.
* **Tools:** Practical usage guides for Nmap, Wireshark, and Linux CLI.
