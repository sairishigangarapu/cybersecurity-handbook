# 6. Malware

**Malware**, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, or network, leak private information, or gain unauthorized access to a system.

## Key Malware Characteristics

- **Attack Vector**: The path or means by which an attacker gains access to a target to deliver a malicious payload. Common vectors include email attachments, malicious websites, and removable media.
    
- **Infection Mechanism**: How the malware spreads and embeds itself into a system.
    
- **Payload**: The malicious action the malware performs once it has infected a system (e.g., deleting files, encrypting data, stealing credentials).
    

## Types of Malware

### Virus

A type of malware that, when executed, replicates by inserting copies of itself (possibly modified) into other computer programs or data files.

- **Key Trait**: Requires a host program to run and needs human action (like opening a file) to spread.
    
- **Subtypes**:
    
    - **Program Virus**: Infects executable files (e.g., .exe, .com).
        
    - **Boot Sector Virus**: Infects the master boot record (MBR) of a drive.
        
    - **Macro Virus**: Written in a macro language and embedded in documents (e.g., Word, Excel).
        
    - **Multipartite Virus**: Infects both boot sectors and executable files.
        

### Worm

A standalone malware program that replicates itself to spread to other computers.

- **Key Trait**: Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program and can spread across a network without any human interaction. Worms often exploit vulnerabilities in network services to propagate.
    

### Trojan (Trojan Horse)

Malware that is disguised as or concealed within legitimate software. It tricks the user into installing it, and once active, it performs malicious actions in the background.

- **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: A common type of trojan that provides the attacker with covert remote administrative control over the victim's computer.
    

### Ransomware

Malware that denies a user access to their files or system by encrypting them. The attacker then demands a ransom payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key.

- **Test Tip**: The best defense against ransomware is having regular, tested, offline backups.
    

### Rootkit

A collection of software tools designed to gain administrative-level ("root") control over a system while simultaneously hiding its own presence. Its primary goal is stealth and persistence. It can often modify core system files or the kernel to prevent detection.

### Spyware

Malware that secretly gathers information about a person or organization without their knowledge and sends it to another entity.

- **Keylogger**: A type of spyware that records every keystroke made on a system, used to capture passwords and other sensitive information.
    

### Adware

Software that automatically displays or downloads unwanted advertising material when a user is online.

### Logic Bomb

A piece of malicious code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met (e.g., a specific date/time, or the termination of an employee's account).

### Backdoor

A covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, or embedded device. It may be intentionally designed by the original developer or installed by an attacker.

## Advanced Malware and Techniques

- **Fileless Malware**: A type of malware that exists exclusively as a memory-based artifact. It does not write any part of its activity to the computer's hard drive, making it very difficult for traditional antivirus solutions to detect. It often uses legitimate tools like PowerShell to execute its commands.
    
- **Polymorphic & Metamorphic Malware**:
    
    - **Polymorphic**: The malware encrypts its payload differently with each infection. The decryption routine changes, but the core malicious code remains the same.
        
    - **Metamorphic**: The malware completely rewrites its own code with each infection. This makes it extremely difficult to detect using signature-based methods.
        
- **Dropper/Downloader**: Malware designed to install other malware. A dropper contains the payload within itself, while a downloader connects to the internet to retrieve the main payload. This is often the first stage of an infection.
